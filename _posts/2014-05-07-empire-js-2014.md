**Coming Soon!**

Look for me to talk about my experience at [EmpireJS](http://2014.empirejs.org/) and a list of takeaways from speakers.
<!-- I went to the [EmpireJS](http://2014.empirejs.org/) conference thanks to [Work-Bench](http://www.work-bench.com). It was a great first conference to be at because I consider myself an amateur javascripter so there was so much to learn. Most importantly, as someone who has primarily programmed in Ruby and the Rails framework, I had really only seen the power of jQuery. Throughout the conference, I was both amazed and excited about the potential for JavaScript moving forward.
