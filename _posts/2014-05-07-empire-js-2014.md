**Coming Soon!**

Look for me to talk about my experience at [EmpireJS](http://2014.empirejs.org/) and a list of takeaways from speakers.
<!-- I went to the [EmpireJS](http://2014.empirejs.org/) conference thanks to [Work-Bench](http://www.work-bench.com). It was a great first conference to be at because I consider myself an amateur javascripter so there was so much to learn. Most importantly, as someone who has primarily programmed in Ruby and the Rails framework, I had really only seen the power of jQuery. Throughout the conference, I was both amazed and excited about the potential for JavaScript moving forward. These are my five takeaways.

1. Styleguide talk (talking about a specific pain point)

2. PhantomJS talk (even though I am not there yet, I took a similar path and can get there, cool problem and solution)

3. Japanese Art (so much value added, idea of working on your own passions and also helping the greater community)

4. JavaScript and robots, art (JS can do so much)

5. Meme talk/ReactJS/Nodejitsu(?) talk (idea of how the community can shape the future of programming)
