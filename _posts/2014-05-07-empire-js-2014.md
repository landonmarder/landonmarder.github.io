I went to the [EmpireJS](http://2014.empirejs.org/) conference thanks to [Work-Bench](http://www.work-bench.com). It was a great first conference to be at because I consider myself an amateur javascripter so there was a lot that I could learn. Most importantly, as someone who has primarily programmed in Ruby and the Rails framework, I had only, up to this point, included jQuery in my programmer's toolbelt. Throughout the conference, I was both amazed and excited about the potential for JavaScript moving forward. These are my five takeaways. **Coming Soon!**
